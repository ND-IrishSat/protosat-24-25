    '''
    ideal test case for UKF: zeroed out, nonmoving cubesat
    0 reaction wheel speed and angular velocity, constant magnetic field
    no frame of reference transformation or gps implementation

    THINGS CHANGED FOR TEST CASE ONE:
        removed hfunc and passed gps_data as magnetic field
        
        removed normalization

        removed zCov
        
        need to find optimal starting r, q for each case

        got rid of different dimensionality for m: instead, everything uses 7

        switched covariance calculation to option 1

        fixed crosscovariance calculation bug

        created diagonal starting covariance

        what is control input vector in EOMs?
